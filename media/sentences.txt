When you have a dream, you’ve got to grab it and never let go
There is nothing impossible to they who will try
The bad news is time flies. The good news is you’re the pilot
Success is not final; failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream
"Stop saying "I wish" start saying "I will
.It does not matter how slowly you keep going as long as you dont stop
Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears
Without fear courage cannot exist
Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving
